# Medical Insurance Project

Suppose you are a medical professional curious about how certain factors contribute to medical insurance costs. Using a formula that estimates a personâ€™s yearly insurance costs, you will investigate how different factors such as age, sex, BMI, etc., affect the prediction.

**Note**: While insurance companies do use BMI in their calculations, and that is reflected in this project, BMI is not necessarily an accurate predictor of health. As data scientists, we should always be skeptical of quantitative measures like BMI that reduce complex phenomena to a single number.
