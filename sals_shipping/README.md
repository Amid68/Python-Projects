# Sal's Shipping

Sal's Shipping is a Python program developed as part of the Learn Python 3 course on Codecademy. This program represents Sal's Shippers, the biggest shipping company in the tri-county area. The primary goal of this program is to provide customers with the most affordable shipping options based on the weight of their packages.

## Features

- **Ground Shipping**: Calculates shipping cost based on the weight of the package with a small flat charge.
- **Ground Shipping Premium**: Offers shipping at a higher flat charge without weight-based pricing.
- **Drone Shipping**: A new shipping method that charges based on weight but has no flat charge, typically at a higher rate than ground shipping.
