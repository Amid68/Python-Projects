# Getting-Ready-for-Physics-Class-Python

This project is part of the "Learn Python 3" course on Codecademy. 

**Description:** 
As a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester, this project provides functions to calculate fundamental physical properties for students. 

**Functions Included:**
1. `f_to_c(f_temp)`: Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.
2. `c_to_f(c_temp)`: Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
3. `get_force(mass, acceleration)`: Calculates force using mass and acceleration.
4. `get_energy(mass)`: Calculates energy using mass and the speed of light (optional parameter).
5. `get_work(mass, acceleration, distance)`: Calculates work using mass, acceleration, and distance.
