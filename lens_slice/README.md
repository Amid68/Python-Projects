# Len's Slice

Welcome to the Len's Slice project, a part of the Codecademy's Learn Python 3 course. In this project, you'll work with lists to organize sales data for a fictional pizza joint named Len's Slice.

## Overview

You'll use Python lists to track pizza toppings and prices, determine the number of pizzas with a specific price, and sort pizzas from the cheapest to the priciest. This project will help reinforce your understanding of Python lists, methods associated with lists, and list manipulation.

## Features

- Track different kinds of pizza toppings and their prices.
- Count the number of pizzas that are sold at $2.
- Determine the total number of different kinds of pizzas sold.
- Sort pizzas by price and identify the cheapest and priciest options.
- Modify the list of pizzas and prices to include new items.
- Find the three cheapest pizza options available.

## Concepts Covered

- List creation and initialization
- Counting items and determining list length
- Sorting lists
- Inserting into and removing items from lists
- Slicing lists to obtain sublists

## Running the Project
