# Gradebook Project

This project is a simple Python script designed for students to organize their subjects and grades efficiently. It demonstrates the use of lists to manage and manipulate data, such as subjects and corresponding scores, including both current and previous semester grades.

## Features

- Creation of a gradebook for the current semester with subjects and grades.
- Addition of new subjects and grades.
- Modification of grades and annotation of completion status.
- Combination of last semester's gradebook with the current semester's gradebook for a full academic overview.

This script is a practical application of Python list operations, including appending, removing, and modifying list items, and it serves as an educational tool for understanding data organization in Python.

Part of the "Learn Python 3" course on Codecademy, this project is aimed at beginners looking to apply fundamental Python concepts in a real-world scenario.
